Welcome to the Docker Companionâ€”a comprehensive resource designed to facilitate effective learning and application of Docker for computer science students. This guide is meticulously structured into three key sections, each serving a distinct purpose in the learning journey:

### 1. **Demonstrations**
The Demonstrations section is designed for classroom presentations. It showcases practical examples and workflows, enabling students to observe Docker in action. Each file in this section includes:

- **Demonstration Goal**: A brief overview of the objectives for the demonstration.
- **Step-by-Step Demonstration**: Detailed procedures, including annotated source code, to ensure clarity and comprehension.
- **Summary**: A concise recap of the demonstrated concepts and techniques.

This section is tailored to provide a foundational understanding and context for students during live sessions.

### 2. **Examples**
The Examples section empowers students to explore Docker features independently. Each example file is crafted to offer hands-on learning opportunities and includes:

- **Learning Goal**: A clear articulation of the specific feature or skill the example aims to teach.
- **Example Implementation**: All necessary code and instructions for practical experimentation.
- **Conclusion**: A summary of the key takeaways and results from the example.

Through this section, students can deepen their understanding by actively engaging with Docker and testing its capabilities.

### 3. **Resources**
The Resources section serves as a knowledge base and reference library. It provides detailed documentation on various Docker features. Each file focuses on a single feature and includes:

- Comprehensive explanations.
- Best practices and tips.
- Examples of real-world usage.

This section is intended to support students in building a robust theoretical foundation and as a reliable reference during their Docker projects.

By combining live demonstrations, interactive examples, and an extensive knowledge base, this companion is structured to support diverse learning styles and ensure a thorough understanding of Docker. Dive in and explore the power of containerization!
